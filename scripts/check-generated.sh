# CI's drift gate: regenerate everything from registry/ and fail if the result differs from
# what is committed. Same shape as the `check-generated` target in
# opentelemetry-weaver-examples/basic/Makefile.
#
# The comparison is against HEAD, not against the index. `git diff` alone compares the working
# tree to the index, and scripts/generate.sh has already overwritten the working tree by the
# time it runs — so a generated file edited but not committed, or staged but not committed,
# reported OK locally while CI failed on the same commit.
